Threads are important kernal level processes that manages operating systems 
GoRoutine is a user function that operates along side other goroutines concurrently inside their code. 
The benefits of using go routines are
utilizes a small stack size compared to threads (2kb vs 1.2mb), which allows less waste when dealing with lower memory processes.
Goroutine can run multiple processes at once which is the most crucial difference.
